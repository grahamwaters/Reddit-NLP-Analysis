The end goal for our client is likely a more clinical application of classification to assist users seeking help on public forums by using psychoanalysis from text data; however, this is beyond the scope of our initial study. Instead, we hope that by learning how these subreddits present linguistically, we gain insight into the most predictive features that can serve as the first stepping stone toward such a clinical application in the future.

**Note**: This study is focused solely on linguistic features present in Reddit posts and is not a formal means of diagnosis for identifying autism-spectrum or obsessive-compulsive disorder.


**Problem Statement:**
A wealthy donor with a track record of philanthropic contributions to both Autism and OCD research organizations contacted our organization, asking for a model they can utilize to identify post characteristics on Reddit.
The purposes of this study (towards those ends) are to:

1) Use Pushshift API to scrape Reddit posts from the Autism and OCD subreddits.
2) To build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a post is from the Autism or OCD subreddit
