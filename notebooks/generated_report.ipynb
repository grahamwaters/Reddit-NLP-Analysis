    "A wealthy donor with a track record of philanthropic contributions to both Autism and OCD research organizations contacted our organization, asking for a model that they can utilize to identify post characteristics on Reddit.\n",
    "The purposes of this study (towards those ends) are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Use Pushshift API to scrape Reddit posts from the Autism and OCD subreddits.\n",
    "2) To build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a post is from the Autism or OCD subreddit\n",

    "To accomplish these goals, we hypothesize that count vectorization, and Logistic Regression, Adaboost, or Decision Trees can be used to build a model that accurately can predict whether a post is from the Autism or OCD subreddit. Success in this study would mean that our model has a misclassification rate of less than 10% and an accuracy score of greater than 90% on the test data set.\n",

    "This process took the most time and thought out of any of the sections of this study. During the first iteration and early stages of the project, scores were very high (around 0.98 R2) with little to no data cleaning. However, the model was overfitting and was not generalizable to new data. I had to go back and clean the data to get a more generalizable model. I also identified data leakage due to the words `OCD` and `autism` being present in the titles and selftext fields of the posts. I removed these words from the titles etc., and re-ran the model. This resulted in a decrease in the R2 score.\n",

    "STIC is an acronym that repeatedly appears in autism posts. For future research I would eliminate this from the analysis or add it to the stop words. In addition I would also remove sensory processing disorder and anything to do with sensory systems. It's also possible that terms like stimming and sm, or tantrum Could be overpowered when it comes to a pure word analysis and may lead to overfitting. I accounted for some of this in my analysis but further analysis would benefit from a more rigorous application of regex and data cleaning to identify new word patterns that could be skewing results one way or the other. Accuracy can be a misleading metric and depending on the goals of the project we may want to optimize for something like an F1 score in the future as opposed to pure accuracy and a comparison to baseline.\n"

There are 15 people any any time in probably a 100 year old femaleemalet by 100 year old femaleemalet enclosed space. We had open concept before. I am drowning here and having a breakdown. Everyone is poo-pooing my issues. They tell me it is temporary (it will go on 4-6 months). They tell me I'm not the only have to put up with that. They do not know that I am stic. The walls are keeping the sound in and the air out. I have a lot of sensory dysfunction. It is too hot in here because there is no ventilation (this might be temporary until they work out the airlow) and I'm extremely sensitive to heat, and it is making me extremely dizzy. I am dealing with a lot of extra noise and people. My is through the roof. People eat at their desks and in this enclosed space it is creating a lot of extra scents that, while not unpleasant, is strong and I cannot deal with. The construction is creating extra dust and allergens. I feel that these walls are closing in on me. People pick up the phone constantly and it is amplified by the enclosed walls. The list goes on. I want to take short term disability (my company provides it, full base salary for 3 months) while this construction is going on, but I don't know how I can even get a medical professional to approve it. Now I am a person who has not called in sick a single day in the 20+ years My family doctor refuses to deal with mental health issues and referred me to a shrink which I can only see next year.

It also scored extremely high on the test data, which was an indicator that some features within the data were overpowering the model and causing it to overfit. One could stop there and be done with their analysis, saying that the model does technically predict which subreddit a post belongs to, but I wanted to see if I could improve the model for scalability. For this reason, I moved the next stage and created my Beta Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "My Beta Models were able to predict with 91.8% accuracy (on the test set) whether a post was from the Autism or OCD subreddit. This is a significant improvement over the baseline accuracy of 50%. However, it is still not good enough to be used in a production environment. The model is still overfitting, and I believe that this is due to the fact that the data is not clean enough. There are still a lot of words that are not relevant to the model, and I believe that if I were to clean the data further, I would be able to improve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final recommendations are that we number one gather more data and consistently measure these two subreddits to gain a more holistic understanding of what these populations enjoy, what they participate in, what kinds of verbs they use, or nouns they prefer. I would also really like to explore one of the features that I created that has to do with questions. How many users post questions versus discussions and are these skewed towards one or the other forum?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 8949 unique users in the data frame and this is a large number when you consider the neuro diversity that exists not only on a spectrum but also on the side of OCD.
